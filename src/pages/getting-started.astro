            <h2>1. Omnibar</h2>
            <p>Omnibar is a user's personal navigation kit. It holds everything a user needs 
                to navigate the app they're currently in, apps they typically go to, and apps they might 
                need, as well tools to customize their navigation experience through notifications, 
                language options, and help resources.</p>
            <h2>1. App Launcher</h2>
            <p>App launcher is a persistent navigation component for users to switch context. It is a 
                personal local map to navigate the Tyler ecosystem. It lives in the user information section 
                of omnibar and is represented by the Apps icon.</p>
            <h2>Scaffold layout</h2>
            <p>The scaffold provides the basic page layout for Tyler apps.</p>
            <h2>Colorr</h2>
            <p>The Material Design color system uses an organized approach to applying color to your UI. 
                In this system, a primary and a secondary color are typically selected to represent your 
                brand.</p>
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>Tyler Forge provides a purposeful set of typographic styles. Consistently tying typographic 
                styles to appropriate sections and functions in an interface creates clear visual patterns 
                and expectations.</p>

                personality and familiarity and can make complex ideas more accessible.</p>
